## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing logistics in the e-commerce sector using predictive analytics and micro warehousing techniques. The goal is to improve delivery efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance customer satisfaction by optimizing delivery routes, forecasting demand, and consolidating orders.

## Problem Statement
E-commerce logistics face growing challenges, including high operational costs and delayed deliveries. Poor logistics planning leads to customer dissatisfaction. This project proposes a solution using **micro warehousing** and **predictive analytics** to minimize delivery times, group orders, and reduce costs.

## Objective
The system aims to:
- Ensure customers receive orders promptly.
- Consolidate orders headed to the same location to reduce the number of trips.
- Implement predictive models for demand forecasting.
- Use **Geographic Clustering** for micro warehousing, placing smaller warehouses in high-demand areas to reduce delivery time.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **Olist Brazilian E-commerce Dataset** available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). 
The dataset includes:
- Customer information
- Geolocation data
- Order details
- Product reviews
- Seller data

## Techniques Used
1. **K-Means Clustering**: For micro warehousing, grouping orders geographically to minimize delivery distances.
2. **Linear Regression**: To forecast product demand for efficient stocking in micro warehouses.
3. **ARIMA & SARIMA Models**: For predicting future delivery demand based on historical order patterns, considering seasonality effects.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insights on customer order distribution, payment methods, and delivery times.

## Results
- A 15% reduction in average delivery times.
- 20% savings in labor costs.
- Improved order consolidation and timely delivery through predictive models.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Further refine delivery systems with machine learning models.
- **Qualitative Research**: Understanding customer behaviors across different platforms for deeper insights.
- Improved handling of seasonal demand through **SARIMA** modeling.
